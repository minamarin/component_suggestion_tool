# Visa Component Suggestion Tool	

## Overview
A simple React app that allows developers to describe a UI and receive relevant Visa Product Design System components (stubbed) and auto-generated code snippets.

## Tech Stack
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Visa Nova Styles
- Rule-based keyword matching for component suggestion

## Features
- Free-form description input
- Suggested Visa components with descriptions
- Auto-generated code snippet area
- Copy to clipboard
- Nova theme customization
- Accessible UI (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## AI Usage
 I used ChatGPT to:
- Draft basic architecture 
- Refine filtering logic
- Improve README structure
All logic and coding decisions were self-directed, with AI used as a pair-programmer reference.

## Next Steps (If More Time):
- create an API.
- use AI. I didn't go for this and first option due to time constraints (3-4hrs only)
- VSCode extension prototype
- Favorite queries/snippet saving
